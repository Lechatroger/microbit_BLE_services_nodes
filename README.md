# Node-RED functions for microbit

One Paragraph of project description goes here

# 1.Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## 1.1.Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### 1.1.1.On the Raspberry Pi

Install https://github.com/sandeepmistry/node-bbc-microbit
Place 'Microbit_2.0' folder in your Node-RED functions folder: /home/pi/.node-red/lib/functions



## 1.2.Development

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

### 1.2.1.Microbit with Microbit online Javascript compiler

For basic usage of the microbit, the 'microbit-BLE.hex' is appropriated. It only activates all bluetooth services. The services needed are then chosen on Node-RED (see section 1.2.3).

1)  Drop microbit-BLE.hex on microbit

### 1.2.2.Microbit with Mbed online compiler

### 1.2.3.Raspberry PI

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

# 2.Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
